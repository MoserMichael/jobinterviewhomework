Assignment:



Create a microservice which serves the contents of player.csv through REST API.



The service should expose two REST endpoints:

    GET /api/players - returns the list of all players.
    GET /api/players/{playerID} - returns a single player by ID.



After implementing the basic functionality consider the following (as time allows): testing, edge cases, optimizations, deployment.



Instructions:



    Please send your solution back within 24 hours.
    You should spend no more than 3 hours working on it. We're not looking at a "perfect" solution, but we are looking for a high level of code.
    After implementing the basic functionality, consider the following - Error and Exception handling, testing and edge cases (must). (Performance and deployment can be considered "time permitting")

* recruiter tips â€“ also consider the following - doker, db, pagination , rest standards

    Document what you would do additionally or differently if you had infinite time.
    You should use JAVA as programming language, and can choose any framework / library / data storage.
    If you have any implementation questions: make an assumption that makes the most sense, write it down, and go ahead with implementation.





Have fun with it!
